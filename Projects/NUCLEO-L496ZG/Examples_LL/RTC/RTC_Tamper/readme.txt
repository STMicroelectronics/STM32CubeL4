@par Example Description

Configuration of the Tamper using the RTC LL API. The peripheral initialization 
uses LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

In this example, after start-up, SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using the PLL with
MSI as clock source.

The RTC peripheral configuration is ensured by the Configure_RTC() function 
(configure of the needed RTC resources according to the used hardware CLOCK, 
PWR, RTC clock source and BackUp). You may update this function to change RTC configuration.

The associated firmware performs the following:
1. It configures the Tamper pin to be falling edge, and enables the Tamper 
   interrupt.
2. It writes the data to all RTC Backup data registers, then check whether the 
   data were correctly written. 
   If data are correctly written, LED1 toggles fast (200 ms-period).
   If they aren't, LED1 toggles slowly (1 sec.-period).   
3. Applying a low level on the USER_BUTTON_PIN (PC.13) by pressing User push-button,
   the RTC backup data registers are reset and the Tamper interrupt is generated. 
   The corresponding ISR then checks whether the RTC Backup data registers are cleared. 
   If data are properly cleared, LED1 toggles fast (200 ms-period).
   If they aren't, LED1 toggles slowly (1 sec.-period).

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L496xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
