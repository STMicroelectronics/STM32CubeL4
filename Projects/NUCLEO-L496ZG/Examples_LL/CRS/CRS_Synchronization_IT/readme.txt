@par Example Description

How to configure the clock recovery service in IT mode through the
STM32L4xx CRS LL API. The peripheral initialization uses LL unitary
service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

At the beginning of the main program the SystemClock_Config() function is used to 
configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 80 MHz.

Then, HSI48 and LSE oscillators are enabled. 
In this example, after pressing the user button, as a first step a synchronization miss is raised 
when using a wrong synchronization source i.e. GPIO with nothing connected (instead of LSE). 
In a 2nd step, a reconfiguration is done to use LSE source and reach the correct synchronization.
HSI48 synchronize to LSE (32768Hz), adjusting the trimmer such to get the counting to 48000000/32768. 

In this test, this is the scenario:
 - set the source to GPIO and then enable IT
 - Wait for User push-button press to start the test (Fast toggle )
 - to provoke a SYNC event, call the software event generation function
 - Interrupt is raised to indicate a SYNC MISS and then power on 
 - in main program, wait for 1 sec and reconfigure source to LSE
 - Interrupt is raised to indicate a SYNC OK and then power on 
 - Toggle quickly  when SYNC WARN is detected
 - Increase tolerance (FELIM value) when SYNC WARN is detected
 - At the end of the test  should be OFF.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L496xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) Set-up
    - Connect the MCO pin to an oscilloscope to monitor HSI48 frequency:
      - PA.08: connected to pin 23 of CN12 connector for Nucleo-144 (MB1137)


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
