@par Example Description

How to use the OPAMP peripheral in PGA mode (programmable gain amplifier). To test the
OPAMP, a voltage waveform is generated by the DAC and feeds the OPAMP
input. This example is based on the STM32L4xx OPAMP LL API. The peripheral
initialization is done using LL initialization function to demonstrate
LL init usage.

Example configuration:
Operational amplifier instance OPAMP1 is configured in PGA mode.
OPAMP non-inverting input and output are set to be connected to GPIO pins.
OPAMP inverting input is not connected externally (internal connection in PGA mode).

Other peripherals configured in this example:
One DAC channel, one DMA channel and one timer are configured to generate a voltage
waveform to test the OPAMP:
sinus waveform, frequency 1kHz, amplitude Vdda/10 (amplitude is chosen to have 
OPAMP output not saturated with OPAMP PGA gains 2, 4, 8 and saturated
with OPAMP PGA gain 16).

Example execution:
From the main program execution, LED1 is toggling quickly while waiting for
user button press.
Then, the OPAMP is enabled and the waveform to test OPAMP is generated.
At each press on push button, the OPAMP PGA gain is modified: 2, 4, 8, 16
and LED1 is toggled.
After the last gain, OPAMP PGA gain is set to 2 and LED1 is turned-on.

Connection needed:
To check OPAMP functionality, you can:
 - Either use the waveform generated in this example by DAC1 channel1:
   connect DAC channel output to OPAMP non-inverting input (see pins below, with list of GPIO used).
   This waveform generation can be disabled by commenting literal definition "WAVEFORM_VOLTAGE_GENERATION".
 - Either connect a voltage to OPAMP non-inverting input (see pins below, with list of GPIO used)
   between ground (0V) and Vdda (3.3V).
 - Either use an external power supply
Voltage amplified by the OPAMP can be observed on OPAMP output (see pins below, with list of GPIO used).

Other peripheral used:
  1 GPIO for push button
  1 GPIO for DAC channel output PA.04 (Board Nucleo144: morpho connector CN11 pin 32 (in front of Arduino connector CN9 pin A2), Zio connector CN7 pin 17)
  1 GPIO for OPAMP non-inverting input: PA.00 (Board Nucleo144: morpho connector CN11 pin 28 (in front of Arduino connector CN9 pin A0), Zio connector CN10 pin 29)
  1 GPIO for OPAMP output: PA.03 (Board Nucleo144: Arduino connector CN9 pin A0, Zio connector CN12 pin 37)
  For waveform voltage generation: 1 DAC channel, 1 DMA channel, 1 timer.
