@par Example Description 

How to use the built-in PGA mode (OPAMP programmable gain).

- Test description:
      - The example uses the the built-in PGA mode (OPAMP programmable gain).
      - The DMA provides samples (sinewave) to the DAC. 
      - The DAC peripheral generates a sine wave signal on DAC_OUT1 (PA4) which is
        amplified by the OPAMP1. 
      - The OPAMP1 amplifies output is on PA3 with gain of either 2 or 4.
        The OPAMP gain is changed on the fly while OPAMP remains enabled.
      - The OPAMP is used in both normal and low power mode (sample and hold mode). 
      - The low power mode of OPAMP (and DAC)can also be used while Cortex stays 
        in sleep mode.
      - The Cortex can be set into sleep mode with no DMA interrupt handling. 
      - The tests steps are:
      - Step 0:
      	DAC:     normal power mode
      	OPAMP:   normal power mode - gain = 2
      	DMA:     circular mode - DMA half transfer IT handled by Cortex
      	Cortex:  run mode
      - Step 1:
      	DAC:     normal power mode
      	OPAMP:   normal power mode - gain = 4
      	DMA:     circular mode - DMA half transfer IT handled by Cortex
      	Cortex:  run mode
      - Step 2:
      	DAC:     Low power mode
      	OPAMP:   Low power power mode - gain = 4
      	DMA:     circular mode - DMA half transfer - no IT handled by Cortex
      	Cortex:  run mode
      - Step 3:
      	DAC:     Low power mode
      	OPAMP:   Low power mode - gain = 4
      	DMA:     circular mode - DMA half transfer - no IT handled by Cortex
      	Cortex:  sleep mode
      - Step 4:
      	DAC:     Low power mode
      	OPAMP:   Low power mode - gain = 2
      	DMA:     circular mode - DMA half transfer - no IT handled by Cortex
      	Cortex:  sleep mode

@par Hardware and Software environment  
  
  - This example runs on STM32L496ZG devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) Set-up :
    
      - Connect an oscilloscope to (DAC_OUT1, PA4: pin32 - connector CN11) pin 
        to display the sine wave signal generated by the DAC 
        (800 mV amplitude peak to peak). (DAC output = OPAMP input).
      - Connect an oscilloscope to (OPAMP_OUT1, PA3: pin37 - connector CN12) pin to display waveform  
        (OPAMP output)
      - Press user button to switch between steps.
      - You may redo the tests, either via
        -> changing sample and hold parameters of the DAC.
        or through 
        -> commenting #define CHANGE_GAIN_IN_SLEEP_IN_MAIN 1 in main.h
           if you with gain to be modified via IT (i.e. not in main).

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
