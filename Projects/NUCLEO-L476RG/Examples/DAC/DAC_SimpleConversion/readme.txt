@par Example Description 

How to use the DAC peripheral to do a simple conversion.

      - The example uses the DAC for a simple conversion in 8 bits right 
      	alignment of 0xFF value, the result of conversion can be seen by 
      	connecting PA4(DAC channel1) to an oscilloscope. 
      	The observed value is 3.3V.
      - The low power mode of DAC (sample and hold mode) can also be used while Cortex 
        is in sleep mode.
      - The tests steps are:
      - Step 0:
      	DAC:     normal power mode
      	Cortex:  run mode
      - Step 1:
      	DAC:     Low power mode
      	Cortex:  Sleep mode
      

NUCLEO-L476RG Rev C board's LED can be used to monitor the process status:
  - LED2 is slowly blinking (1 sec. period) and example is stopped (using infinite loop)
  when there is an error during process.

@par Hardware and Software environment  
  - This example runs on STM32L476xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L476RG Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-L476RG Rev C Set-up 	
    
      - Connect PA4 (DAC Channel1) (pin 32 in CN7) to an oscilloscope.
      - Press user button to switch between steps.
      - You may redo the tests by changing the sample and hold parameters 
        of the DAC.        
      

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
