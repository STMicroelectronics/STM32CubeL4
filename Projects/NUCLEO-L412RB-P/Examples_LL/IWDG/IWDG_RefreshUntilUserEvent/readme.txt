@par Example Description

How to configure the IWDG peripheral to ensure periodical counter update and 
generate an MCU IWDG reset when a User push-button is pressed. The peripheral 
is initialized with LL unitary service functions to optimize 
for performance and size.

Example Configuration:
Configure the IWDG (prescaler, counter) and enable it.
Infinite refresh of the IWDG down-counter done in the main loop.
LED4 is blinking fast & continuously.

Example Execution:
When User push-button is pressed, the down-counter automatic refresh mechanism is 
disabled and thus, reset occurs. After a reset, when re-entering the main function, 
RCC IWDG Reset Flag is checked and if we are back from a IWDG reset the LED4
is switched ON.

Waiting a new User push-button pressed to re-activate the IWDG
