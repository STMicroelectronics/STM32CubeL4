@par Application Description

Use of the USB device application based on the Human Interface (HID) with 
Link Power Management Protocol (LPM).

This example is part of the USB Device Library package using STM32Cube firmware.

STM32L412xx USB FS USB device supports the Link Power Management Protocol (LPM-L1) and complies with the USB 2.0
LPM-L1 ECN. The hpcd.Init.lpm_enable in the usbd_conf.c should be set to 1 to enable the support for LPM-L1
protocol in the USB stack.

LPM-L1 allows a USB host to configure the USB device into inactive state much faster than the normal
USB suspend mode (L2).
It also provides much faster wake-up times in the order of micro-seconds compared to the generic resume
by host or upstream resume by device.

When LPM packet is received from Host, STM32 USB will Acknowledge the LPM packet
and it will enter in L1 suspend mode. During USB L1 suspend mode ,system will be
in STOP low power mode.

On Host L1 resume, STM32 will wakeup from STOP and USB resumes operations.

You can test L1 suspend/resume, by running the USBCV3.0 chapter9 for USB2.0 devices .
Please note that for running USBCV3.0, you'll need a PC with a USB3.0 (xHCI)
host controller (please refer to USBCV3.0 documentation for more information).

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 80 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock HSI48 USB Clock.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

For more details about the STM32Cube USB Device library, please refer to UM1734
"STM32Cube USB Device library".

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L412xx devices.
  - This demo has been tested with NUCLEO-L412RB-P board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - Since there is no USB 2.0 Full speed connector (Type B) on the nucleo board, user has to make
    his own USB shield daughter board with the a USB connector and plug it on top of the  CN6
    connectors of the NUCLEO-L412RB-P. The USB connector has to be connected to the USB device associated GPIOs
    as follows:
    - DP (D+ of the USB connector) <======> PA12 (Nucleo board)
    - DM (D- of the USB connector) <======> PA11 (Nucleo board)
    To improve EMC performance (noise immunity and signal integrity), it is recommended to connect a 100nF
	ceramic capacitor to the USB VDD pin.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
