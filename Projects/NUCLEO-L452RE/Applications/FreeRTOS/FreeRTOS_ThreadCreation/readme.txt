@par Application Description

How to implement thread creation using CMSIS RTOS API. 

This application creates two threads with the same priority, which execute in 
a periodic cycle of 5 seconds for Thread 1 and 10 seconds for Thread 2. 

Thread 1 toggles LED2 every 250 milliseconds for 5 seconds then resumes Thread 2
and suspends itself. Thread 2 resumes and toggles LED2 every 500 milliseconds
for 10 seconds, then Thread 2 resumes Thread 1 and suspends itself.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR.
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then
      the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than
      the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority()
      function.
 
@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set accordingly to the 
      OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.

on STM32Cube with RTOS".
