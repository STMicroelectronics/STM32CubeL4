/*
  "The hash processor is a fully compliant implementation of the secure hash algorithm 
(SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256), the MD5 (message-digest algorithm 5) hash algorithm and 
the HMAC (keyed-hash message authentication code) algorithm suitable for a variety of 
applications. It computes a message digest (160 bits for the SHA-1 algorithm, 256 bits for 
the SHA-256 algorithm and 224 bits for the SHA-224 algorithm,128 bits for the MD5 
algorithm) for messages of up to (264 – 1) bits, while HMAC algorithms provide a way of 
authenticating messages by means of hash functions. HMAC algorithms consist in calling 
the SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256 or MD5 hash function twice.

The FIPS PUB 180-2 standard and the IETF RFC 1321 publication specify the SHA-1, SHA-
224 and SHA-256 and MD5 secure hash algorithms, respectively, for computing a 
condensed representation of a message or data file. When a message of any length below 
264 bits is provided on input, the SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256 and MD5 produce 
respective a 160-bit, 224 bit, 256 bit and 128-bit output string, respectively, called a 
message digest. The message digest can then be processed with a digital signature 
algorithm in order to generate or verify the signature for the message. Signing the message 
digest rather than the message often improves the efficiency of the process because the 
message digest is usually much smaller in size than the message. The verifier of a digital 
signature has to use the same hash algorithm as the one used by the creator of the digital 
signature.
The SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256 and MD5 are qualified as “secure” because it is 
computationally infeasible to find a message that corresponds to a given message digest, or 
to find two different messages that produce the same message digest. Any change to a 
message in transit will, with very high probability, result in a different message digest, and 
the signature will fail to verify. For more detail on the SHA-1 or SHA-224 and SHA-256 
algorithm, please refer to the FIPS PUB 180-2 (Federal Information Processing Standards 
Publication 180-2), 2002 august 1.

The current implementation of this standard works with little-endian input data convention. 
For example, the C string “abc” must be represented in memory as the 24-bit hexadecimal 
value 0x434241.
A message or data file to be processed by the hash processor should be considered a bit 
string. The length of the message is the number of bits in the message (the empty message 
has length 0). You can consider that 32 bits of this bit string forms a 32-bit word. Note that 
the FIPS PUB 180-1 standard uses the convention that bit strings grow from left to right, and 
bits can be grouped as bytes (8 bits) or words (32 bits) (but some implementations also use 
half-words (16 bits), and implicitly, uses the big-endian byte (half-word) ordering. This 
convention is mainly important for padding.
                         
Data are entered into the hash processor 32 bits (word) at a time, by writing them into the 
HASH_DIN register. But the original bit-string can be organized in bytes, half-words or 
words, or even be represented as bits. As the system memory organization is little-endian 
and SHA1, SHA-224 and SHA-256 computation is big-endian, depending on the way the 
original bit string is grouped, a bit, byte, or half-word swapping operation is performed 
automatically by the hash processor.
The kind of data to be processed is configured with the DATATYPE bitfield in the HASH 
control register (HASH_CR)."

/*
  "The HASH sequentially processes blocks of 512 bits when computing the message digest. Thus, each time 16 x 32 bit words (512 bits) have been written by the DMA or the CPU, into the hash processor, the HASH automatically starts computing the message digest. This operation is known as a partial digest computation. The message to be processed is entered into the peripheral by 32 bit words written into the HASH_DIN register. The current contents of the HASH_DIN register are transferred to the input FIFO (IN FIFO) each time the register is written with new data. HASH_DIN and the input FIFO form a FIFO of a 17 word length (named the IN buffer). The processing of a block can start only once the last value of the block has entered the IN FIFO. The peripheral must get the information as to whether the HASH_DIN register contains the last bits of the message or not. Two cases may occur. When the DMA is not used, in case of a partial digest computation, this is done by writing an additional word into the HASH_DIN register (actually the first word of the next block). Then the software must wait until the processor is ready again (when DINIS is equal to 1) before writing new data into HASH_DIN, in case of a final digest computation (last block entered), this is done by writing the DCAL bit to 1. When the DMA is used, the contents of the HASH_DIN register are interpreted automatically with the information sent by the DMA controller. In case of a single DMA transfer, Multiple DMA transfer (MDMAT) bit should be cleared. When the last block has been transferred to the HASH_DIN register via DMA channel, DCAL bit will be set to automatically to 1 in the HASH_STR register in order to launch the final digest calculation. In case of a multiple DMA transfer, Multiple DMA transfer (MDMAT) bit should be set to 1 by software so DCAL bit does not get set automatically by HW, in this case the final digest calculation for hash and for each phases for HMAC (for more details about HMAC phases please refer to HMAC operation section) will not be launched a the end of the DMA transfer request, allowing the processor to receive a new DMA transfer. During the last DMA transfer, Multiple DMA transfer (MDMAT) bit should be cleared by software in order to set automatically DCAL bit at the end of the last bloc and lunch the final digest. The contents of the HASH_DIN register are interpreted automatically with the information sent by the DMA controller. This process (data entering and partial digest computation) continues until the last bits of the original message are written to the HASH_DIN register. As the length (number of bits) of a message can be any integer value, the last word written into the HASH processor may have a valid number of bits between 1 and 32. This number of valid bits in the last word, NBLW, has to be written into the HASH_STR register, so that message padding is correctly performed before the final message digest computation.  Once this is done, writing into HASH_STR with bit DCAL equal to 1 starts the processing of the last entered block of message by the hash processor. This processing consists in automatically performing the message padding operation. The purpose of this operation  is to make the total length of a padded message a multiple of 512. The HASH sequentially processes blocks of 512 bits when computing the message digest computing the final message digest When the DMA is enabled, it provides the information to the hash processor when it is transferring the last data word. Then the padding and digest computation are performed automatically as if DCAL had been written to 1."
